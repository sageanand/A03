STEP BY STEP TUTORIAL ON HOW TO USE GIT/GITHUB. 
*These steps are neccessary to succesfully be able to setup and use GITHUB*
*All of the definitions of the terms used in the steps are down below* 

**Step #1** - Create a GitHub account (github.com) and choose the free version. 

**Step #2** - Create a new repository (This will allow you to organize a project. A repository can also contain folder and files, images, videos, etc. 
         **Step #2.1** - In order to create a repository, click (New Repository) on upper right hand corner. 
         **Step #2.2** - Name the repository (It is better to name the repository depending on the project you are working on)
         **Step #2.3** - Choose public or private repository (Depending on if you would like to share your repository with other members                          of your group or not)
         **Step #2.4** - Click Create Repository

**Definitions** - 

GIT -
GIT is a freely distributed version control that is used to create or manage a project's source code history. GIT was first released in 2005 and is currently maintained by LINUX foundation. The primarily and the basic focus of such a tool is code sharing and is widely used in various universities.

GITHUB -
GITHUB is primarily considered as a cloud based hosting service. It is centralized around source code hosting and GIT repositories. 

REPOSITORY -
In the simplest form, a Repository can be defined as a physical or a digital space or stored data of project bones, files, directories, etc. Similarly, Repository in GIT and GITHUB contains all of the projects files, revision history, and bare bone versions of any particular project created by the user. 

CLONE -
Cloning in GIT or GITHUB is used to create a local copy of the code or project bones/files on your computer or sync between two locations. It is mainly used to clone repositories in GITHUB to save the user/programmer for having to manually initialize the submodules and files later. 

COMMIT -
Commit can be described as the alteration to a specific file or bunch of files supported with a brief description of a commit message that contains the information on all of the changes that were made in the project. 

PUSH -
Push is one of the most widely used tool in GITHUB. Push allows the user/programmer to basically send the source code created/altered locally to the repository hosted on GITHUB which allows other users to access them. 

PULL -
Pull is another most widely used tool in GITHUB which allows the user/programmer to copy or fetch in the data from the online repository and merging the data with the project files in the local system so that the files are up to date.

BRANCH -
In the simplest manner, branch can be defined as a parallel version of the master repository that was created by the user which further allows the user/programmer to work freely without any disruptions. This keeps the master branch safe from unwanted and wrong changes made to the source code. 

MERGE -
Merge is usually used to merge in the contents or the source code and the changes made in one file of the same repository or a different repository to another. Merge also performs automatically after the pull request is made by the user. 

MERGE CONFLICT -
Merge conflict can occur when the source code in a file pulled from the GITHUB repository to the local system or vice versa contains conflicting data/changes. 

FETCHING -
Fetching is a tool used to fetch the code from GITHUB's online repository without merging them with the current source code saved on your local system. This is widely used to compare the original source code/files with an altered version without changing any data on your local file. 
 
REMOTE -
Remote in the most easiest way can be defined as a common version of the repository hosted on the server. This allows the user to share a common repository to make exchange data or make changes to a specific project.
